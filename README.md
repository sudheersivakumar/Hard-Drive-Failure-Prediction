# Hard-Drive-Failure-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict hard drive failures using historical data and supervised learning techniques.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict hard drive failures using supervised learning techniques. The model is trained on historical data to identify patterns that precede failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and reduced downtime.

## Project Structure
- `hard_drive_failure_model.pkl`: The trained machine learning model.
- `hard_drive_failure_prediction.py`: The script used for making predictions.
- `hard_drive_scaler.pkl`: The scaler used for normalizing the data.
- `harddrive.csv`: The dataset containing historical hard drive data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
